This is a plugin for [DokuWiki](https://www.dokuwiki.org).

For more information on installation and usage, please visit the [documentation](https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:custommeta) on DokuWiki.

#### Description

This is a very basic plugin that allows adding custom metadata to a wiki page. This plugin (currently) does NOT interact with [native metadata](https://www.dokuwiki.org/devel:metadata) used by DokuWiki or metadata added by other plugins.

The metadata to be added must be declared using a specific syntax in the page text. The declaration supports both visible and invisible modes. In visible mode, the declared value will be present and readable as part of the page content. In invisible mode, the declaration will be hidden.

The plugin allows you to define whether the metadata should be stored as a string (default), integer, or a UNIX timestamp.

All added metadata will be appended to the page's .meta file within an array called “custommeta.” This prevents any modifications made by this plugin from interfering with the metadata used by DokuWiki or other plugins.

#### Motivation

This plugin arises from two motivations. The first is that the other two available plugins that can interact with page metadata have, to varying degrees, errors that make them unstable. Secondly, this plugin is designed to be used with a [fork](https://github.com/Kromtar/plugin-pagelist/tree/custom-meta-cols) I created of [pagelist](https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:pagelist). In this fork, I have added the functionality to add custom columns to the tables generated by the plugin and fill them with information from the metadata of the listed pages ( image).
